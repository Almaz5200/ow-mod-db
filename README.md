# Outer Wilds Mod Database

Uses the mod list in [`mods.json` of the `source`](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-db/blob/source/mods.json) branch, fetches the required data for each mod. That data is then added to [`database.json` in the `master` branch](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-db/blob/master/database.json). The process happens automatically every once in a while.

## [Click here to add your mod to the database](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-db/issues/new?assignees=Raicuparta&labels=add-mod&template=add-mod.yml&title=%5BYour+mod+name+here%5D)

Or, if you want, you can [edit the mod list yourself and open a PR](https://github.com/Raicuparta/outer-wilds-mod-db/edit/source/mods.json)

## How it works

GitHub Actions are used to periodically update the database. Check the [Update Releases workflow](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-db/blob/source/.github/workflows/update-releases.yml) and the [TypeScript code](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-db/tree/source/fetch-mods) that fetches the data about each mod and generates the database.
